// Declare a variable and assign it to a numeric value
let num  = 8

// Double that value and re-assign it to the previous variable
num = num*2
console.log(num*2)


// Create two numbers, assign them to variables and add them together
let x = 10
let y = 20
console.log(x,y)


// Create three numbers, assign them to variables and subtract the smaller two from the largest
const a = 11
const b = 15
const c = 23
const sub = b-a-c
console.log(sub)

// Create two even numbers, assign them to variables and divide one from the other
 let a = 2;
 let b = 6;
 console.log(a/b)


// Create two odd numbers, assign them to variables and multiply one from the other
let a = 2;
let b = 4;
console.log(a*b)


// Create a variable and log it's remainder, if divided by 3, to the console 
const numc=7;
const remain = numc % 3;
console.log(remain)


// Answer in plain text, what is modulo especially useful for?
(in number theory) with respect to or using a modulus of a specified number. Two numbers are congruent modulo a given number if they give the same remainder when divided by that number:
"19 and 64 are congruent modulo 5"
console.log(120%2) // 1 and 0 true or false
let num = 20;
if(num%2{
    console.log('odd')
})
